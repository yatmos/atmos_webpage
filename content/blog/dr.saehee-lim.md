#### Abstract

Air Quality and climate are strongly influenced by natural and anthropogenic emissions of aerosols. Quantifying their emission sources and variability is complex but is essential for air quality regulation and climate change projection. Among atmospheric composition, black carbon (BC), emitted directly by fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning, is recently recognized as the strongest short-lived climate-forcer and as a good indicator of adverse health effects of airborne particles. However, little is known about past and present emissions of BC and atmospheric aging processes, which can lead to bad air quality and climate warming via modifying its chemical, physical, and optical properties in the atmosphere.

Since 2000 in Europe, BC is the subject of increasing attention due to its co-benefits for climate and air quality, yet little observational evidence exists both temporally and spatially. Based on a novel technique, single particle soot photometer (SP2) to measure refractory BC (rBC), the ice-core record of Mt. Elbrus, Caucasus (5115 m a.s.l.), covering the period 1825-2013, reflects rBC particles transported from the European continent with a recent stronger rBC input from both anthropogenic and open-fire emissions of the Eastern part of Europe. Today in East Asia, a hot spot of atmospheric BC, SP2-based ambient single-particle measurements show that physical properties (size and mixing state) of BC from local emissions in Seoul are distinguished from those in Chinese plume, providing an insight into emission sources and atmospheric processes of BC particles in East Asia. Furthermore, the high proportion of internally-mixed BC with non-absorbing materials during haze events highlights potentials for haze pollution development and health impacts involving BC particles. Consequently, it is urgently needed to improve scientific understanding on BC microphysics in order to implement new mitigation strategies.
